1. Introduction:
InteractiveMap - jQuery plugin that allows for the conclusion of active regions on the document with the ability to set the color, border and background transparency.
Basic data for the plug-in can be transmitted in the form of a standard JavaScript object, and in the format JSON, the last plug-in allows you to synchronize
web-server-side applications and realize the dynamic addition of elements.

2. Features:
- Conclusion of the active regions in the images and any block page elements;
- The ability to dynamically change the basic settings via the plug-in JSON;
- Easy synchronization with AJAX;
- Ability to set the transparency of the active regions, and set the color by an alias;
- Ample opportunities to configure the active regions;
- Support for user-defined functions.

3. Basic use:
The plug-in can be applied to any block elements and images on the page.
If the item is not an image in order to plug-in correctly identified the location of the active regions, the element for which it is invoked is to have a relative position.
If the item is an image, the output of the active regions occur immediately after loading the image.

To connect a plug-in, use the following code:

$ ("# YourId").interactiveMap({
   coordsObj: {"item1": "top": "52", "left": "396", "height": "31", "width": "31", "item2": "top": "52" , "left": "539", "height": "93", "width": "86"}
   dataObj: {"item1": "some data to item 1", "item2": "some data to item 2"},
   setQueue: true,
   onClick: someFunction
});

4. Options:
coordsObj - Object or JSON containing coordinates elements. The coordinates can be specified in CSS-form, using {top: 100, left: 100, width: 100, height: 100}, and the form of coordinates points {x1, y1, x2, y2}
dataObj - Object or JSON containing the data of elements. To these were tied in the correct order, the keys dataObj must fully comply with keys coordsObj
showOptionsObj - Object or JSON containing additional options for active regions. It may contain the following keys:
  1. activeItem - highlight the active area immediately after the page will be loaded (activeItem: coordsObj.key)
  2. activeItemSort - highlights the active region at the beginning (first) or at the end load (last). If not specified, it will be highlighted in sequence (activeItemSort: "last | first")
  3. Also you can redefined properties "fillColor", "hoverFillColor", "staticFillColor" for each of the active region (coordsObj.key: {"hoverFillColor": "blue"})

strokeColor - A string that prepended the color of the border. Can be HEX, RGB or alias. Default: #ffffff
strokeWidth - A number that prepended the thickness of the border. Default: 2
strokeType - A number that prepended the type of border. Can be one of dotted, solid, double or dashed. Default: solid
fadeTime - A number that prepended the time of occurrence. Default: 500
showBorder - If set to true the border will be displayed. Default: true
fillColor - A string that prepended the background color of the active regions. Can be HEX, RGB or alias. Default: #ffffff
fillOpacity - A double that prepended the transparency of the background of the active regions. Can be between 0 or 1. Default: 0.5
hoverFillColor - A string that prepended the background color of the hover active regions. Can be HEX, RGB or alias. Default: red
hoverFillOpacity - A double that prepended the transparency of the background hover active regions. Can be between 0 or 1. Default: 0.5
staticFillColor - A string that prepended the background color of the highlight active region. Default: #green
staticFillOpacity - A double that prepended the transparency of the background the highlight active region. Can be between 0 or 1. Default: 0.5
setStatic - If set to true active region will be highlighted after click. Default: true
hideStatic - If set to true highlighted will be remove after click on the same active region. Default: false
setQueue - If set to true active regions will be show up in queue. Default: false
setPause- If set to true set pauses equal fadeTime at the beginning of the withdrawal of active regions in the queue. Default: false
enableClose - If set to true allows you to delete active regions manually. Default: false
setStaticClose - If set to true leaves a close button for a highlight element. Default: true

onClick - Callback function called when active region clicks
onClose - Callback function called when active region closes
onStaticClick - Callback function called when highlight region clicks
onMouseOut - Callback function called when active region mouse out
onMouseOver - Callback function called when active region mouse on
onRender - Callback function called when active regions render
onRemove - Callback function called when active regions remove

5. API-methods:
CreateItems() - Creates a visible objects of map after plugin initialization
createOne(coords, data, options) - Takes a Object or JSON of coordinates, information and additional options for active regions and displays them on the screen.
removeItems() - Removes all active regions
removeOne(className) - Removes the active region by the name of the class
